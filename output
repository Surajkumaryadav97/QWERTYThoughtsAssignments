Diameter will be 40 because this is referencing to the current function
and in JS function has its own constructor and currentobject is circle  due to this radius will be
in its scope.

Perimeter will be NaN because this.radius is now not referencing to 
the circleobject,it is referencing to the GLOBAL object.
